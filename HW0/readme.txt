    1. Intended platform for final project (e.g. Android, iOS)
        The intended platform for our group's final project is iOS. However, throughout the project 
        we mainly intend to use Android emulators for testing of the application as all three of us have Windows machines.
        Eventually we plan to try running the application on iOS. We are not entirely sure as to how this will all play out 
        and is therefore subject to change as we go along. 
    2. Intended framework/programming language for your final project (e.g. Kotlin, Swift)
        We have chosen to use React Native. This is because it allows us to develop for both iOS and Android. Specifically, 
        all three of us have Windows machines so developing for eventual use on iOS would not be possible 
        otherwise (or at least as easy without using VMs). I have a older MacBook that we have discussed could be used 
        for the eventual testing of the application on iOS, but it is not my primary device.
    3. Whether you want to explore cross-platform development
        Yes, in our group we have discussed wanting to explore cross-platform development. This is because we 
        want to develop an app for iOS on Windows and we will need to test it throughout the development. 
        We plan to do so, as mentioned above, by using React Native and testing the app through the development process
        on Android emulators. Then near the end we would like to attempt running it on an iOS device.
